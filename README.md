## Installing openfe locally

To run the notebook locally, you'll need to install **openfe**:

Installing from conda-forge is simplest, and you can use `micromamba` (recommended), `mamba` or `conda`:

```bash

micromamba create -n openfe openfe=1.8.1
micromamba activate openfe

```

then open the demo with `jupyter notebook src/openfe_demo.ipynb`.
